# CrashCourse2.0

2nd Frontend Design

This is my version of Design Course's Frontend Development 2022 Crash Course. 
Things I learned: 

HTML: 
 1) SVG tag
 2) How to correctly import and link fonts

CSS:
 1) Transform properties like translateX/Y()
 2) Transition properties like ease-in-out, alternate-reverse
 3) One animation-fill-mode property which is forwards
 4) Z-index and how useful it is when it comes to bringing forward/backward an element
 5) List-style-type: none which removes any list's marker.
 6) The clip-path property which makes image transitions more unique

JS: 
 1) const x = document.querySelector('.x') which means that I'm obtaining the HTML class (.x) and assigning a JS variable (x) to it to reference later
 2) How to remove an element by using x.classList.remove('y'). This works well when making mobile navigation bars. This command makes it so that the bar can be closed and won't be stuck forever on the screen when opened.
